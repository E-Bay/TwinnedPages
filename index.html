        <ol>
        <li><a href="A/index.html">Breakfast one</a>

        <p>For this assignment, fork <a href="https://github.com/michaelkbradshaw/TwinnedPages">this</a> repository with your partner. 
            It contains two folders with identical websites.</p>
        <p> Your mission is to alter the files <code> A/style.css</code> and <code>B/style.css</code> in order to create two websites that look different, even though they have the same content.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>You may not alter the html files in any way, except for the notes.html page which is yours to fill out</li>
        <li>You must incorportate an image (only using CSS).  Place images in the imgs folder.  You will need to provide a relative path of ../imgs/picture.jpg</li>
            <li>You may only use images that you have created yourself or that have been released for use by the public.  Please attribute all collected material in your notes.html page.</li>
        <li>You must use at least one instance of the psuedo selector :hover.  You should research it on 
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp"> w3schools</a>.</li>
        <li>While you will be serving breakfast two ways, you should ensure that both of you "servings" are complimentary.  For instance one can have a dark theme, while the other can be light.</li>
        <li>Please avoid the mistake of saying, hey, there are two of us, and we need 2 css files.  Lets split it.   This technique doesn't work.  Work together, the product will be better and you'll both learn more.  Plus once you do one of these, the other is typically easier.</li>
            <li>Submit the URL to WDD when you finish</li>
        </ol>
